# Hackathon-september-2024

## Guidelines 
- Teams have to create a fork of this particular repo on start of hackathon.
- Rename the repo as per the team name when you create the fork
- Once you select the problem statement that you are going to work on, create a file as initial.md and give your team name, team members name and the problem statement you are trying to solve. Do this within first one hour of starting the hackathon. 
- At the end of hackathon timing, STGI team will create a copy all the repos that are forked and only that will be used for evaluation. So ensure the code is committed to the forked repo only.
- Do continuous commits to your own forks so that we can evaluate the commit history as well.
- You can place your presentation and videos if any within the same repo by creating a new folder.


### All the very best..!! Happy Hacking..!!
